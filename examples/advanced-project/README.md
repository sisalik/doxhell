# Advanced project
This a more advanced example Python project that has doxhell-enabled documentation and
unit tests. It is intended to showcase more of doxhell's features.

You can try running the following commands against it:
```
doxhell review
doxhell render requirements
doxhell render protocol
doxhell render coverage
```

The *DOC-***.pdf* files in this directory illustrate the output of the above `render`
commands.

Also see *pyproject.toml* for some custom settings that have been defined for doxhell
when it runs in this project.
