# Simple project
This is a simple example Python project that has doxhell-enabled documentation and unit
tests. It is intended as a bare minimum example to demonstrate the ease of integration.

You can try running the following commands against it:
```
doxhell review
doxhell render requirements
```
The [sample-requirements.pdf](sample-requirements.pdf) file illustrates the output of
the above `render requirements` command.

Test protocol and coverage report rendering is not available, since there are no
template files present for these.
